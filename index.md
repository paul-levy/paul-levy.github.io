## Computational Neuroscience | Data Science | Machine Learning

Computational neuroscientist with 11+ years of experience including signal processing, machine learning, visual psychophysics, and experimental design.
I worked on motion capture for the Xbox Kinect as an intern at Microsoft.
I completed my PhD studying visual representation using physiology, psychophysics, and computational modeling in the Movshon + Simoncelli labs at NYU.
I then joined Wispr, a wearables startup, where I worked on challenging, and research-oriented problems in neural interfaces. 

Through roles in neuroscience, software, and human-computer interfaces, I've developed problem-solving expertise via hands-on research experiences - reach out if you want to talk about relevant opportunities!

## Industry projects

#### Neural interfaces wth Wispr

*Computational Neuroscientist, collaborating with*

*Approaches: Experimental design, signals processing, machine learning*

I owned a variety of projects that shaped the product roadmap and related prototypes for a wearable neural interface. 
I analyzed multi-modal time-series data (EMG, IMU, video, audio), built data pipelines (computer vision, signal processing), and conducted model feature exploration.


#### Motion Capture for Microsoft's Xbox One Kinect
*Software Engineering Intern*

A cutting-edge device for human-computer interaction, the Kinect allowed user motion to be used as input to the Xbox One.
I worked to create an automated pipeline for high-quality, labeled data by parsing motion capture data for use by the Kinect's machine learning models which could replace a labor-intensive, manual process.

## Academic projects

#### Spatial frequency selectivity in thalamus and primary visual cortex

*With Tony Movshon, Eero Simoncelli*

*Approach: Physiology, modeling, psychophysics*

*Aim:* Selectivity for the spatial scale of images begins in the earliest stages of vision, but undergoes a transformation towards
sharper and more varied selectivity in visual cortex. We manipulate the contrast and spatial frequency content of images to probe the 
differential representations in the thalamus and primary visual cortex, and explore their underlying mechanisms and computation.
Working with electrophysiological data and computational models, we have uncovered 
interesting properties of contrast gain control and the hierarcical processing of stimulus selectivity.

#### Saccadic Suppression

*With Roozbeh Kiani, Marc Zirnsak*

*Approach: Human psychophysics*

*Aim:* Visual perception is altered during saccadic eye movements. We used a detection task to densely sample changes in achromatic luminance sensitivity around the time of saccades.
This has enabled us to better understand the spatiotemporal profile of saccadic suppression, uncovering important asymmetries with respect to gaze.
