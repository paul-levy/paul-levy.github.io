## About Me

In the Spring of 2023, I started as a Computational Neuroscientist at <a href="wispr.ai">Wispr</a>.
I completed my PhD at New York University's Center for Neural Science, co-advised by Tony Movshon and Eero Simoncelli. 
There, I studied visual representation using physiology, psychophysics, and computational modeling.

## Current projects

#### Spatial frequency selectivity in thalamus and primary visual cortex

*With Tony Movshon, Eero Simoncelli*

*Approach: Physiology, modeling, psychophysics*

*Aim:* Selectivity for the spatial scale of images begins in the earliest stages of vision, but undergoes a transformation towards
sharper and more varied selectivity in visual cortex. We manipulate the contrast and spatial frequency content of images to probe the 
differential representations in the thalamus and primary visual cortex, and explore their underlying mechanisms and computation.
Working with electrophysiological data and computational models, we have uncovered 
interesting properties of contrast gain control and the hierarcical processing of stimulus selectivity.

#### Saccadic Suppression

*With Roozbeh Kiani, Marc Zirnsak*

*Approach: Human psychophysics*

*Aim:* Visual perception is altered during saccadic eye movements. We used a detection task to densely sample changes in achromatic luminance sensitivity around the time of saccades.
This has enabled us to better understand the spatiotemporal profile of saccadic suppression, uncovering important asymmetries with respect to gaze.
